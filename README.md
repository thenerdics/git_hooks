#Git hook configuration

This repo allows you to build git hooks using commit-msg as an example
Enter your desired bash logic into the commit-msg file,
to test your script run the file ./installHooks <filename || partial filename match>
Upon completion the file will be in the ./test directory, if successfull it will have the same
name as the file you have in the root repository

##It is important to ensure you do not change the filenames as these are structured for git compatability
